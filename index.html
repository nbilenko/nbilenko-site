					I am a machine learning engineer, experienced with image and video data (scientific and medical), predictive modeling, and data visualization. I am particularly interested in algorithm interpretability and human-computer interaction. My goal is to create algorithms and applications that are more equitable and are designed to serve humans that they impact the most.
				</p>
				<p>
					From 2016 to 2019, I worked as a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://captionhealth.com" target ="_blank">Caption Health</a> (formerly Bay Labs), designing algorithms and software for detection and diagnosis of heart disease based on ultrasound imaging. I cofounded the diversity and inclusion working group and helped start the internship program at the company. I also managed the global outreach program, through which we collaborated with the nonprofit organization <a href="https://teamheart.org/" target="_blank">Team Heart</a> in Rwanda.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before that, I received a PhD from the <a href="https://neuroscience.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute</a> at UC Berkeley, where I was supervised by <a href="https://gallantlab.org" target="_blank">Jack Gallant</a> (yep, that's a video of my brain). For my disseration, I modeled similarities across people's brain responses to movies and speech to study how different kinds of information are represented in the brain. While at Berkeley, I received a Masters in <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">computer science</a>, advised by <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~maneesh" target="_blank">Maneesh Agrawala</a>. My thesis project was a web tool for creating custom visualizations of texts that reflected character relationships and emotional trajectories.

			<h3>Advocacy</h3>
			<p>
				I volunteer for <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">Code for America</a>: <a href="https://openoakland.org/" target="_blank">Open Oakland</a>. We are building a website and API for air quality data in support of the <a href="https://www.woeip.org/" target="_blank">West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project</a>, a community-based environmental justice organization.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am an organizer for <a href="https://queerinai.org" target="_blank">Queer in AI</a>, a group working to raise awareness of queer issues in machine learning and to forge a community of queer researchers. In December 2019, we hosted a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/queer-in-ai/neurips-2019" target="_blank">workshop</a> at <a href="https://neurips.cc" target="_blank">NeurIPS 2019</a> in Vancouver, where I moderated an expert panel on algorithmic inequity and its impacts on marginalized groups. Most recently, we hosted a social event at <a href="https://fatconference.org" target="_blank">ACM FAT* 2020 conference</a>. Please feel free to email me if you'd like to get involved.
			</p>
			<p>
				I serve as a mentor for two organizations promoting science and artificial intelligence education for students underrepresented in those fields: <a href="https://www.cientificolatino.com/" target="_blank">Cient√≠fico Latino</a>, a mentorship program for PhD applicants in STEM, and <a href="http://ai-4-all.org/" target="_blank">AI4All</a>, an education program for high school students interested in AI.
			</p>
			<p>
				I contribute to strategic planning for the <a href="https://lighthouse3.com/diversityinai/" target="_blank">Women in AI Ethics directory</a> created by Mia Dand at <a href="https://lighthouse3.com/" target="_blank">Lighthouse3</a>.
			</p>

			<h3>Art and design</h3>
			<p>
				I love scientific art and design, and I'm starting to work on a new collaborative art project - more on this soon!
			</p>
			<p>
				I am co-leading a workshop at the <a href="https://ctrlz.ai" target="_blank">CtrlZ.AI Zine Fair</a> in association with the <a href="https://fatconference.org" target="_blank">ACM FAT* 2020 conference</a> called <i>Our Relationship with AI: Exploring the Present + Dreaming Up Radical Futures</i> in collaboration with some brilliant and creative folks: <a href="https://pkalluri.github.io" target="_blank">Ria Kalluri</a>, <a href="http://www.michellercarney.com/" target="_blank">Michelle Carney</a>, <a href="https://raphagl.com" target="_blank">Rapha Gontijo Lopes</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~creager/" target="_blank">Elliot Creager</a>. If you'd like to participate in an asynchronous part of our workshop, please take this <a href="https://forms.gle/uK7AGVoJzowBam6JA" target="_blank">survey</a> about your casual encounters with AI.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was part of the team that created <a href="http://drbrainlove.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Brainlove</a>, an interactive climbable brain sculpture with EEG-based programmable lights. Dr. Brainlove went to Burning Man twice and participated in the <a href="http://www.bayareasciencefestival.org/" target="_blank">Bay Area Science Festival</a>, and I moderated a panel on Dr. Brainlove at <a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2015/2015/events/event_IAP38468" target="_blank">South by Southwest Interactive</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				For an exhibition at the <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/" target="_blank">Exploratorium</a> on cognitive technologies, I co-developed the <a href="http://www.explorecogtech.com/projects.html#TME" target="_blank">Mind's Eye</a>, an installation for interactively exploring predictive modeling and decoding of brain activity via motion and gesture sensing, with <a href="https://caseforge.co/" target="_blank">James Gao</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a graduate student at Berkeley, I was a designer for the magazine <a href="https://berkeleysciencereview.com/" target="_blank">Berkeley Science Review</a> and led development for our first mobile app.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm learning how to draw! Advice welcome.
			</p>

			<h3>(More) personal</h3>
			<p>
				I love dark comedy, cooking and baking, breweries, squirrels, the outside world, and meditation. I especially enjoy experiencing some of these things with my partner <a href="https://swfrench.com/" target="_blank">Scott</a>.
