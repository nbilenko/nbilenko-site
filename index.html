					I am a freelance machine learning engineer, experienced with image and video data (scientific and medical), predictive modeling, and data visualization. I am particularly interested in algorithm interpretability, opacity, and fairness. My goal is to create more equitable algorithms and algorithmic applications.
				</p>
				<p>
					From 2016 to 2019, I worked as a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://captionhealth.com" target ="_blank">Caption Health</a> (formerly Bay Labs), designing algorithms and software for detection and diagnosis of heart disease based on ultrasound imaging. I co-created the company diversity and inclusion working group and helped start the internship program. I also co-managed the global outreach program, through which we collaborated with the nonprofit organization <a href="https://teamheart.org/" target="_blank">Team Heart</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before that, I received a PhD from the <a href="https://neuroscience.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute</a> at UC Berkeley, where I was supervised by <a href="https://gallantlab.org" target="_blank">Jack Gallant</a>. For my disseration, I modeled similarities across people's brain responses to movies and speech to study how different kinds of information are represented in the brain. While at Berkeley, I received a Masters in <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">computer science</a>, advised by <a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~maneesh" target="_blank">Maneesh Agrawala</a>. My thesis project was a web app for creating custom visualizations of texts that reflected character relationships and emotional trajectories.

		<h3>Advocacy and volunteering</h3>
		<p>
			I volunteer for <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org" target="_blank">Code for America</a>: <a href="https://openoakland.org/" target="_blank">Open Oakland</a>. We are building a website and API for air pollution data in support of the <a href="https://www.woeip.org/" target="_blank">West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project</a>, a community-based environmental justice organization.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am an organizer for <a href="https://queerinai.org" target="_blank">Queer in AI</a>, a group working to raise awareness of queer issues in machine learning and to forge a community of queer researchers. Our next event is a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/queer-in-ai/neurips-2019" target="_blank">workshop</a> at <a href="https://nips.cc" target="_blank">NeurIPS 2019</a> in Vancouver.
		</p>
		<p>
			I serve as a mentor for two organizations promoting scientific and artificial intelligence education for students underrepresented in those fields: <a href="https://www.cientificolatino.com/" target="_blank">Cient√≠fico Latino</a> and <a href="http://ai-4-all.org/" target="_blank">AI4All</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Recently, I joined the inaugural council to help create the <a href="https://lighthouse3.com/diversityinai/" target="_blank">Women in AI Ethics directory</a> created by Mia Dand at <a href="https://lighthouse3.com/" target="_blank">Lighthouse3</a>.
		</p>

		<h3>Art and design</h3>
		<p>
			I love scientific art and visualization, and I'm hoping to find time for a new collaborative art project soon.
		</p>
		<p>
			I was part of the team that created <a href="http://drbrainlove.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Brainlove</a>, an interactive climbable brain sculpture with EEG-based programmable lights. Dr. Brainlove went to Burning Man twice and participated in the <a href="http://www.bayareasciencefestival.org/" target="_blank">Bay Area Science Festival</a>, and I moderated a panel on Dr. Brainlove at <a href="https://schedule.sxsw.com/2015/2015/events/event_IAP38468" target="_blank">South by Southwest Interactive</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			For an exhibition at the <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/" target="_blank">Exploratorium</a> on cognitive technologies, I co-designed an experience called the <a href="http://www.explorecogtech.com/projects.html#TME" target="_blank">Mind's Eye</a> that allowed visitors to interactively explore predictive modeling and decoding of brain activity via motion sensing.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a graduate student at Berkeley, I was a designer for the popular science magazine <a href="https://berkeleysciencereview.com/" target="_blank">Berkeley Science Review</a> and led development for our first mobile app.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm learning how to draw! Advice welcome.
		</p>

		<h3>(More) personal</h3>
		<p>
			I enjoy dark comedy, cooking and baking, breweries, squirrels, and the outside world, especially when experiencing them with my partner <a href="https://swfrench.com/" target="_blank">Scott</a>.
